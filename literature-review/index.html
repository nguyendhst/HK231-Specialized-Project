<a class=anchor href=#existing-low-code-development-platforms-comparion>#</a></h3><p>Low-code Developing is slowly becoming a thing in business environment. And to keep up with the demand, many low-code development platforms have been provided for the business users with a large variety of usage and pricing. Yet, we would like to introduce 3 platforms that we consider the most notable ones. We are going to categorize them into 3 groups:</p><ul><li>Open-source</li><li>Proprietary, free-to-use</li><li>Proprietary, paid</li></ul><h3 id=open-source>Open-source
<a class=anchor href=#open-source>#</a></h3><p>Our candidate for this category is going to be <strong><a href=https://github.com/ToolJet/ToolJet>ToolJet</a></strong>. ToolJet is an open-source low-code framework to build and deploy internal tools with minimal engineering effort. ToolJet&rsquo;s drag and drop frontend builder allows you to create complex, responsive frontends within minutes. Additionally, you can integrate various data sources, including databases like PostgreSQL, MongoDB, and Elasticsearch; API endpoints with OpenAPI spec and OAuth2 support; SaaS tools such as Stripe, Slack, Google Sheets, Airtable, and Notion; as well as object storage services like S3, GCS, and Minio, to fetch and write data.</p><p><img src=https://nguyendhst.github.io/HK231-Specialized-Project/images/tooljet.png alt="ToolJet Demo"></p><h4 id=pros>Pros
<a class=anchor href=#pros>#</a></h4><ul><li>Visual Drag-n-Drop App Builder<ul><li>ToolJet provides a drag-n-drop app builder with a variety of prebuilt resizable components that are ready to use. Each component has its own event handler to trigger an action which is also predefined in the application.</li></ul></li><li>Database:<ul><li>With ToolJet, you can either use its own ToolJet Database or integrate with an existing data sources. ToolJet can support integration with over 40 different data sources, including SQL, MongoDB, FireStore, InfluxDB, MariaDB or even RESTful API.</li></ul></li><li>Collaboration:<ul><li>An app can be edited and customized by multiple users simultaneously with ToolJet&rsquo;s Multiplayer editing.</li></ul></li><li>Version Control:<ul><li>Users can manage multiple application versions with a structured release cycle.</li></ul></li><li>Customization:<ul><li>If prebuilt scripts and components are not sufficent, users can implement their own JavaScript and Python code into the application.</li></ul></li></ul><h4 id=cons>Cons
<a class=anchor href=#cons>#</a></h4><ul><li>Confusing User Experience:<ul><li>Although the drag-n-drop interface provides a decent amount of prebuilt components, interacting with them is not a good experience for newcomers. Moving a component around the canvas can easily trigger an inner component of the component itself. The user will also has no clue how the final page will look like since the canvas only contains components. There is no border or boundary for the user to identify where the component is going to get positioned on the product.</li><li>Components can overlap each other and there is no way to get a component to get on top. For example, if a button component is placed inside of a table component, the moment you hover on the table, it will overlap the button and you will not be able to ever select the button unless you move a table to another position. This might be a feature indicating that components should not overlap each other but ToolJet could have done it in a better way.</li></ul></li><li>High loading time for previewing:<ul><li>It took around 1 to 2 seconds in order to load the preview for the application, which is fine but the way the preview loaded is confusing since initially what you get is a blank page with a page navigation column on the left. There is no indication that the page is still loading and might give the users the feeling of something has gone wrong during the loading process.</li></ul></li><li>Lack of workflow management:<ul><li>Any features related to workflow are nowhere to be found in the main interface. Despite the fact that ToolJet does have a workflow editor, it is still in a beta phase and only available for paid plans.</li></ul></li></ul><h3 id=proprietary-free-to-use>Proprietary, free-to-use
<a class=anchor href=#proprietary-free-to-use>#</a></h3><p>For the next category which is a platform that is proprietary but free to use, we are choosing <strong><a href=https://about.appsheet.com/home/>Google AppSheet</a></strong>, a low-code / no-code platform to build apps and automate work.</p><p><img src=https://nguyendhst.github.io/HK231-Specialized-Project/images/appsheet.png alt="Google Appsheet"></p><h4 id=pros-1>Pros
<a class=anchor href=#pros-1>#</a></h4><ul><li>Friendly User Interface / User Experience:<ul><li>So far, Google Appsheet has the greatest UX of all. All menus and items are placed scientifically so that it gives the user an ease to get started. In addition, the UI is following the philosophy of Material You design from Google just like many other Google apps. This gives a responsive feeling while you are interacting with the platform.</li></ul></li><li>Application Builder:<ul><li>Google Appsheet provides us previews of the application for many types of device, ranging from Mobile to Tablet and even Desktop, without having to make changes for each one. Google Appsheet also has some prebuilt components to add in the applications with a high ability of customization.</li></ul></li><li>Database Integration:<ul><li>Google Appsheet has a prebuilt database and is ready to use, including another platform to directly edit that database just like Microsoft Excel. Beside, Google Appsheet supports integrate data from other sources such as Google Sheets, Google Drive Documents, Cloud Database, etc.</li></ul></li><li>Workflow Automation:<ul><li>Users can define a set of custom processes in Google Appsheet with its Automation page. For each process, Google Appsheet also provides users with some predefined actions such as sending notifications (email, SMS), calling webhook, calling a script from Google AppScript, etc.</li></ul></li></ul><h4 id=cons-1>Cons
<a class=anchor href=#cons-1>#</a></h4><ul><li><p>Limited choices of components:</p><ul><li>One drawback of this platform is its lack of prebuilt components comparing to other platforms. In addition, these components are not drag-n-drop. Therefore you cannot freely set positions of these components. Beside, you can only choose one component per page, which is called a View Type.</li></ul></li><li><p>Limited choices of actions for app components:</p></li><li><p>Limited choices of workflow actions:</p><ul><li>Each step of a process is only given a small amount of actions. If you want to extends the functionality of the automation process, users would have to rely on making a custom Google AppScript script, which is a JavaScript-lookalike scriting language. This really defeats the purpose of a no-code platform as Google has stated.</li><li>Beside, the workflow system in Google AppSheet is pretty much limited in which they can only support simple workflow. There is no branching support in the workflow or so.</li></ul></li></ul><h3 id=proprietary-paid>Proprietary, paid
<a class=anchor href=#proprietary-paid>#</a></h3><p>Due to our financial limitation, we could not really have an insight in platforms that need to be paid in order to start using. However, we end up got suggested with a free to develop platform which is called <strong><a href=https://bubble.io/>Bubble.io</a></strong>. The only catch is that to deploy the application, we need a paid account. Since our scope is focus on researching the platform main functionality, we do not need to deploy anything.</p><p><img src=https://nguyendhst.github.io/HK231-Specialized-Project/images/bubbleio.png alt=Bubble.io></p><h4 id=pros-2>Pros
<a class=anchor href=#pros-2>#</a></h4><ul><li>Friendly drag-n-drop interface:<ul><li>Bubble.io provides an easy to approach visual editor for application GUI. It also includes a large variety of prebuilt elements and an element hierarchy list.</li></ul></li><li>Wide variety of workflow actions:<ul><li>When talking about workflow handling, Bubble.io really stands out with its large amount of predefined actions for workflow handling, ranging from account management to data analytics. In addition, the UX on the workflow dashboard is better comparing to other platforms.</li></ul></li><li>Highly configurable application style:<ul><li>Another Bubble.io&rsquo;s key point is about its ability to customize the interface and styles of the application UI. For each prebuilt components, Bubble.io provides a separate setting panel in which users and freely edit the component.</li></ul></li><li>Localization support:<ul><li>Many languages have already been supported on Bubble.io and can be applied to the application itself. There also exists a dashboard where you can edit custom error messages.</li></ul></li></ul><h4 id=cons-2>Cons
<a class=anchor href=#cons-2>#</a></h4><ul><li>Limited to little connection to external data sources:<ul><li>One drawback of the platform is its inability to connect to external data sources. Every database action must be performed under the database service given by the platform.</li></ul></li></ul><h3 id=platform-comparison>Platform Comparison
<a class=anchor href=#platform-comparison>#</a></h3><p>To summarize, we would like to compare the three mentioned above platforms in a table. And with that in mind, we can choose which function we are implementing in our application.</p><table><thead><tr><th></th><th style=text-align:center>ToolJet</th><th style=text-align:center>Google AppSheet</th><th style=text-align:center>Bubble.io</th></tr></thead><tbody><tr><td>Drag-n-drop Visual Editor</td><td style=text-align:center>✔️</td><td style=text-align:center>❌</td><td style=text-align:center>✔️</td></tr><tr><td>DBMS</td><td style=text-align:center>✔️</td><td style=text-align:center>✔️</td><td style=text-align:center>✔️</td></tr><tr><td>Ability to connect to external data sources</td><td style=text-align:center>✔️</td><td style=text-align:center>✔️</td><td style=text-align:center>❌</td></tr><tr><td>Collaboration</td><td style=text-align:center>✔️</td><td style=text-align:center>❌</td><td style=text-align:center>✔️</td></tr><tr><td>Workflow manager</td><td style=text-align:center>❌</td><td style=text-align:center>✔️</td><td style=text-align:center>✔️</td></tr><tr><td>Customizable components</td><td style=text-align:center>❌</td><td style=text-align:center>❌</td><td style=text-align:center>✔️</td></tr><tr><td>Localization</td><td style=text-align:center>❌</td><td style=text-align:center>❌</td><td style=text-align:center>✔️</td></tr><tr><td>Cross-platform support</td><td style=text-align:center>✔️</td><td style=text-align:center>✔️</td><td style=text-align:center>❌</td></tr></tbody></table></article><footer class=book-footer><div class="flex flex-wrap justify-between"></div><script>(function(){function e(e){const t=window.getSelection(),n=document.createRange();n.selectNodeContents(e),t.removeAllRanges(),t.addRange(n)}document.querySelectorAll("pre code").forEach(t=>{t.addEventListener("click",function(){if(window.getSelection().toString())return;e(t.parentElement),navigator.clipboard&&navigator.clipboard.writeText(t.parentElement.textContent)})})})()</script></footer><div class=book-comments></div><label for=menu-control class="hidden book-menu-overlay"></label></div><aside class=book-toc><div class=book-toc-content><nav id=TableOfContents><ul><li><a href=#literature-review>Literature Review</a><ul><li><ul><li><a href=#existing-low-code-development-platforms-comparion>Existing Low-code Development Platforms Comparion</a></li><li><a href=#open-source>Open-source</a></li><li><a href=#proprietary-free-to-use>Proprietary, free-to-use</a></li><li><a href=#proprietary-paid>Proprietary, paid</a></li><li><a href=#platform-comparison>Platform Comparison</a></li></ul></li></ul></li></ul></nav></div></aside></main></body></html>
