## Domain knowledge
### Promotion campaign

A promotion campaign is a marketing strategy to publicize a product, service, or business through various mediums to increase awareness and sales. It involves carefully planned strategies and tactics, including choosing target audiences, setting campaign objectives, designing promotional messages, and selecting promotional mix elements.

Some methods of this process contain an offer, coupon discounts, free sample distribution, trial offer, buy two items in the price of one, contest, festival discounts, etc. The promotion of a product is important to help companies improve their sales because customers reaction towards discounts and offers are impulsive. In other words, promotion is a marketing tool that involves enlightening the customers about the goods and services offered by an organization.

#### Core domains of promotion campaign

- **Campaign**: Marketing teams can run promotion campaign which involves managing advertising messages, budgets, validity time and benefits for targeted segments of customers. For example: Buy 1 get 1 free, 50% discount for students this summer, etc.

- **Promotion offer**: User benefits such as discount percentage is considered as offers of the campaign. Such offers can be applied to a specific product or a group of products. For example: Discount 20% for all coffee products. Or can be accessed by a voucher code. For example: Extra 10% discount for students with voucher code: STUDENT10

- **Rule**: Each promotion offer has its own ToC (*Terms and Conditions*) that must be satisfied or complied with. In essence, these are business rules. For example, a voucher is only eligible for users who purchase coffee at a Highland Coffee store in HCMC in a business day. Hence, there are 3 conditions for this offer: 
	- Only applies for coffee, 
	- At Highland HCMC and 
	- Time bought must be between Monday-Friday.

- **Effect**: The effect of a promotion offer is the result of applying that offer to an order. For example: A customer buys 2 coffee products with a total price of 100,000 VND. If the promotion offer is 20% discount for all coffee products, the effect of this offer is 20,000 VND.

- **Customer Segmentation/Audience Targeting**: Targeting a specific group of customers to run a promotion campaign so that the suitable offer can be provided. For example: Targeting students to run a promotion campaign aimed at customer with limited budget.
