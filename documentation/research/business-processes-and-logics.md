# Business Processes
Business Process is a set of related, structured activities that are performed in a specific sequence in an organizational and technical environment with the goal of serving a particular business goal. These processes may or may not be visible to the customers.

## Example of Business Processes
### Finance:

- Purchase Order
- Accounts Receivable
- Contract Renewal
- Freelancer Payment
### Sales:
- Sales Pipeline
- Lead Qualification
### IT:

# Business Logics
Inside each Business Process are set of Business Logics that are run either in sequence or in parallel. Generally, our project should provide some basic actions so that the user will not necessarily have to define again.
## Example of Business Logics
### Users Account
- User sign-up
- User sign-in
- Update user's credential details
### App Navigation
- Choose what to display for the user
### Workflow Trigger
- Trigger specific workflow on condition check
### Data Validation
- Validate form input from users
- Validate data from users with database
### Calculation
- Apply discount on item price
### Transaction
- Verify transaction status
- Rollback transaction on error
- Authenticate transactions
### Notification
- Send notifications to users
### Analytics
- Give analytics of a specific entity in database

In addition, the app should allow users to define new business logics or integrate with a third-party plugin (such as Gmail, Outlook, etc). And for clarity, there should be a separation between Business Logics and Application Logics.
