<a class=anchor href=#background-and-motivation>#</a></h2><p>In an era characterized by digital transformation and rapid technological advances, the demand for software applications is skyrocketing. However, the traditional software development approach often requires a significant investment of time and resources, creating barriers for businesses, especially small to medium-sized enterprises (SMEs), that lack these resources. This challenge is further amplified when businesses need to quickly respond to market changes, such as launching promotional platforms to capitalize on emerging opportunities.</p><p>Low-code platforms have emerged as a promising solution to these challenges. These platforms provide an environment where applications can be developed primarily through graphical user interfaces and configurations, rather than traditional hand-coded programming. By reducing the need for extensive coding, low-code platforms enable quicker and more accessible software development, democratizing application development and empowering a wider range of users.</p><h2 id=problem-statement-and-objectives>Problem Statement and Objectives
<a class=anchor href=#problem-statement-and-objectives>#</a></h2><p>Despite the potential of low-code platforms, their adoption for specific use-cases such as promotional platforms remains limited. This limitation arises partly due to a lack of understanding and partly due to the perceived inflexibility of such platforms for specialized applications. Therefore, there is a need to explore the capabilities of low-code platforms in the context of developing promotional platforms and to mitigate existing limitations.</p><p>The objective of this project is to develop a low-code platform that can effectively support the development of promotional platforms. Our goals include:</p><ol><li>Analyzing the specific requirements for promotional platforms.</li><li>Designing a low-code platform that caters to these requirements.</li><li>Implementing and testing the designed low-code platform.</li><li>Demonstrating the effectiveness of the low-code platform on developing a promotional platform.</li></ol><h2 id=overview-and-significance>Overview and Significance
<a class=anchor href=#overview-and-significance>#</a></h2><p>Our proposed low-code platform will incorporate a user-friendly interface for designing the layout and workflow of the promotional platform, a code generator for translating the design into executable code, and a compiler for building and deploying the application. The platform will support the customization required for promotional platforms, such as user management, product management, discount management, and analytics.</p><p>This project holds significant implications for both academia and industry. For academia, it provides an opportunity to explore the intersection of low-code platforms and promotional platforms, contributing to the body of knowledge in software engineering and digital marketing. For industry, particularly for SMEs, this platform could drastically reduce the time, cost, and complexity of developing promotional platforms, thereby enhancing their competitiveness in the market. Furthermore, the low-code approach could potentially allow non-technical staff, such as marketers, to participate in the development process, fostering cross-functional collaboration and innovation.</p></article><footer class=book-footer><div class="flex flex-wrap justify-between"></div><script>(function(){function e(e){const t=window.getSelection(),n=document.createRange();n.selectNodeContents(e),t.removeAllRanges(),t.addRange(n)}document.querySelectorAll("pre code").forEach(t=>{t.addEventListener("click",function(){if(window.getSelection().toString())return;e(t.parentElement),navigator.clipboard&&navigator.clipboard.writeText(t.parentElement.textContent)})})})()</script></footer><div class=book-comments></div><label for=menu-control class="hidden book-menu-overlay"></label></div><aside class=book-toc><div class=book-toc-content><nav id=TableOfContents><ul><li><a href=#introduction>Introduction</a><ul><li><a href=#background-and-motivation>Background and Motivation</a></li><li><a href=#problem-statement-and-objectives>Problem Statement and Objectives</a></li><li><a href=#overview-and-significance>Overview and Significance</a></li></ul></li></ul></nav></div></aside></main></body></html>
