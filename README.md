## Project Overview

This project is a low-code platform for promotion campaign automation. It includes a web application GUI that allows users (*e.g marketing team*) to create and manage promotion campaigns, while ultilizing a Business Rule Engine to handle the evaluation of data. This platform will be designed as a **microservice** to integrate with various platforms, accommodate dynamic business needs, and improve user experience while ensuring efficient operational cost, data security, and flexible deployment options.

The project is developed as part of the **CO4029 Sem 231 - Specialized Project** module at the Ho Chi Minh City University of Technology.

### Project Justification

In the current digital age, businesses are increasingly relying on automation to streamline their processes and improve efficiency. Current major platforms such as Gojek and Lazada relies heavily on promotion campaigns to attract customers. These campaigns are need to be able to serve a large number of customers at the same time, and are often time-sensitive. 

Under the traditional approach, the process of creating and managing these campaigns is often time-consuming and requires a lot of manual work. This can lead to human errors and inefficiency. Multiple data sources and platforms are often involved in the process, which can be difficult to integrate and manage. Therefore, the process of creating and managing these campaigns need to be automated for speed and efficiency.
 
Promotion campaigns, being a critical aspect of marketing, can greatly benefit from automation. The use of a low-code platform can simplify the process of managing these campaigns, allowing non-technical users to contribute effectively and reducing the development time and cost.

## Work Phases

- [ ] [Research Phase](./documentation/research/README.md): This phase involves researching existing low-code platforms, understanding their strengths and weaknesses, and identifying features that would be beneficial for managing promotion campaigns.

- [ ] *W.I.P*

## Project Goals

The expected outcome of this project is a functional low-code platform that simplifies and automates the management of promotion campaigns. It should provide a user-friendly interface, seamless data integration, robust security features, and flexible deployment options. The platform should be able to handle the following tasks:

- **Campaign management**: Marketing teams can run promotion campaign which involves managing advertising messages, budgets, validity time and benefits for targeted segments of customers. A Low-Code GUI is expected to be provided to allow users to create and manage these campaigns.

- **Rule evaluation**: Each promotion offer has its own set of conditions that must be satisfied or complied with. The evaluation of these conditions is expected to be handled by a Business Rule Engine. The platform should be able to integrate with a BRE to evaluate these rules. The evaluation result is then used to determine the effect of the promotion offer.

- **Data integration with existing systema**: The platform should be able to integrate with various data sources and platforms to retrieve data for evaluation. This requires the system to be adaptable to changing business needs and scalable to handle varying volumes of promotion campaigns.
